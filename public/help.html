            <h2>What is smartSLP?</h2>
            <p>
            smartSLP are simple SEP20 (smartBCH's version of SEP20) tokens that have the ability for the creator to mint new tokens (and end the ability to issue new tokens) and for users to burn tokens. They also have a predictable supply mechanism (they are created with X tokens off the bat), whereas SEP20 does not specify a supply mechanism. For tokens that do not need advanced smart contract capability, creating a token using smartSLP is likely all you need to do to start. smartSLP tokens also allow for the inclusion of documentUri's, which makes it easy to notarize something.
            </p>
            <p>
            smartSLP is built on top of smartBCH. By maintaining the smartBCH interface, you can customize this smartSLP manager and add additional advanced functionality on-top of what smartSLP already provides. The manager interface made for smartSLP is designed to be incredibly simple to extend for any additional management of custom token functionality added (such as staking mechanisms, voting, etc.).

            <h2>Create Mainnet Token</h2>

            <h3>Install MetaMask</h3>
            <p>
            To install MetaMask for Chrome, go to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a> and click the Add to Chrome button.
            </p>

            <h3>Get smartBCH for fees</h3>
            <p>
            smartBCH can be exchanged using <a href="https://coinflex.com">CoinFLEX's bridge</a>. Just sign up using MetaMask. Ensure you are using the Ethereum network to signup.
            <br>
            <br>
            Note: CoinFLEX does not accept customers from tyrannical regimes, so if you are unfortunate to live in one of those, it may make more sense to request to trade smartBCH with someone you know who already has some.
            </p>

            <p>
            Once you have registered, you can deposit BCH to CoinFLEX. Ensure the amount is less than $10,000 USD if you want to avoid KYC. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="img/coinflex-deposit-bch.png">
            </p>

            <p>
            Once the BCH has sufficient confirmations, you will be able to withdraw smartBCH. Just select BCH then switch the toggle from BCH to SEP20. Enter your smartBCH address and CoinFLEX will process your withdrawal.
            <br>

            <h2>Setup for Local Testing</h2>

            <h3>Installing Ganache</h3>
            <p>
            Download <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache</a> and start it. Choose "Quickstart Ethereum". Ganache is a graphical application that runs a blockchain that can be used for testing purposes. It runs on 127.0.0.1:7545.
            </p>

            <h3>Installing MetaMask</h3>
            <p>
            To install MetaMask for Chrome, go to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a> and click the Add to Chrome button.
            </p>

            <p>
            To install MetaMask for FireFox, go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/" target="_blank">Firefox Add-ons page</a> and click the Add to Firefox button.
            </p>

            <h3>Configure MetaMask to use Ganache</h3>

            </p>

            <p>
            Click Import with seed phrase. In the box marked Wallet Seed, enter the mnemonic that was displayed when launching Ganache.
            <br>

            </p>

            <p>
            Now we need to connect MetaMask to the blockchain created by Ganache. Click the menu that shows "Main Network" and select Custom RPC.
            <br>
            <img src="img/metamask-select-network.png">
            </p>

            <p>
            In the box titled "New RPC URL" (to the right of "New Network") enter http://127.0.0.1:7545 and click Save.
            </p>

            <p>
            The network name at the top will switch to say "Private Network". Click the cross in the top-right of the current window close out of the page and return to the Accounts page.
            </p>

            <p>
            You are now ready to create a token!

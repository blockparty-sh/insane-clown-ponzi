# Insane Clown Ponzi ðŸ¤¡

Contract Address: 0x01eFaf631Cb58e47B02a98787DCa73e4Dfe5B60D

## Introduction / What is a Ponzi?

Hello and welcome to Insane Clown Ponzi, the first Ponzi DeFI NFT dApp on smartBCH. A "Ponzi" is an advanced financial technique in which your deposits pay past investors, and future investors pay you. This can lead to GIGANTIC gains if you are able to invest before others do, however all money you deposit is effectively immediately gone.

## How do I make money with this?

You must deposit BCH, at this point the BCH is distributed to all others who have invested in the Ponzi before you. a 10% fee is applied, of which 5% is distributed amongst all ðŸ¤¡ and the other 5% is sent to the first who invested in the ponzi.

When others invest in the Ponzi scheme, you will receive a cut of their deposit proportional to your investment in the Ponzi compared to the total Ponzi size, as well as ðŸ§ . This provides an incentive for you to convince others that this is a good idea. Your balance can be withdrawn at any time by clicking the "WITHDRAW" button. There is no minimum to withdraw, and this will not affect your ðŸ§ .

Once you save enough brain you can start claiming ðŸ¤¡. The ðŸ¤¡ will appear in your tent and start dancing. The ðŸ¤¡ receive 50% of the fees, so if you want to make the most money you will want to claim your ðŸ¤¡ right away. Another added benefit, is that by the introduction of a collectible NFT into this Ponzi scheme, it allows others to speculate on the ponzi scheme's fees without actually investing in the Ponzi scheme itself, only by buying ðŸ¤¡ on the secondary market. This innovation is only possible with really smart contracts.

## ðŸ¤¡ Features
As stated above, ðŸ¤¡ enable you to receive fees from future investments. But, that's not all. ðŸ¤¡ also each have their own unique design, name, and they come with a unique motivational quote. In addition, you can watch all of your ðŸ¤¡ dance in the circus tent on the homepage. They are happy now.

## ðŸ¤¡ Bonding Curve
ðŸ¤¡ supply is limited by the amount of ðŸ§  one is able to acquire, and the price of ðŸ¤¡ increases by 1/2021 each time one is purchased. This is known as a bonding curve and is a pillar of 21st century mathematics. You can calculate future ðŸ¤¡ prices by this formula 0.01 * ((1 + 1/2021) ** i) where 0.01 is referring to the price in BCH of the first ðŸ¤¡ and i is the index of the next ðŸ¤¡ to purchase.

## Secondary ðŸ¤¡ Market

### Buying ðŸ¤¡
You may think this is a great idea, but you do not want to invest in a Ponzi scheme, however, you do want to speculate on the future investments into the Ponzi scheme. This is what tokenizing ðŸ¤¡ enables. You may want to purchase ðŸ¤¡ from others in order to receive the fees they receive, or you may want to part with your ðŸ¤¡ in order to invest more in the Ponzi. The possibilities are endless.

### Selling ðŸ¤¡
Currently there is not an NFT marketplace on smartBCH. However, one can trade in a p2p fashion via Telegram or something similar. You can click on the ðŸ¤¡ symbol in the header and then click on the name of the ðŸ¤¡ you want to sell. This will show you a panel that allows you to transfer a ðŸ¤¡ to another address. Be sure to check the address is correct.
